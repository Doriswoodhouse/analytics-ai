# Access Oracle Essbase

This workshop assumes you have access to an Essbase Release 21.5 instance that is deployed and ready to use.

The labs in this workshop will work whether you have an Essbase stack deployment, or an independent deployment.

To access Essbase, you must have the following information:

* URL to access the Essbase web interface
* User name and password to log in to Essbase as a power user

Get the Essbase web interface URL for the Essbase instance you are using from your service administrator. The basic format of the URL is:

```
<copy>https://Host:port/essbase/jet</copy>
```

The default secured port is 9001, unless it was changed during stack creation.
