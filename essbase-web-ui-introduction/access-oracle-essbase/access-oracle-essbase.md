# Access Oracle Essbase

This workshop assumes that you have Essbase deployed and ready to use. The labs in this workshop will work weather you have an Essbase stack deployment, or an independent deployment.

To access Essbase, you must have the following information:

* URL to access the Essbase web interface
* User name and password to log in to Essbase as a power user or service administrator

Get the Essbase web interface URL for the Essbase instance you are using from your service administrator. The basic format of the URL is:

`https://Host:port/essbase/jet`

The default secured port is 9001, unless it was changed during stack creation.

This lab assumes you have:

* Access to an Essbase instance that is deployed and ready to use
* User name and password to log in to Essbase as a power user
* Familiarity with Essbase is desirable, but not required
